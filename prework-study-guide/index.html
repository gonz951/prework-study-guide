        <ul>
          <li>Starting off any code with '!DOCTYPE html' prepares the computer to render it in said coding language.</li>
          <li>The 'doctype' command is <i>not</i> case sensitive.</li>
          <li>The 'head' element contains the information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The 'body' element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The 'title' element is used for the title of the webpage.</li>
          <li>Adding 'html lang="eng"' lets the browser know the website is written in english.</li>
          <li>The 'p' element is for paragraphs.</li>
          <li>The 'br' element is for breaks between elements in the page.</li>
          <li>The 'ul' element is for unordered lists, but the 'ol' element is for ordered lists (AKA: numbered list).</li>
          <li>Both types of lists need the 'li' element to add points to the list.</li>
          <li>An image 'src' allows the computer to locate which files an image is located in.</li>
          <li>The 'a' (anchor) element starts off a link and href will allow the computer to find the link stated.</li>
          <li>'h1' should only be used once on a page.</li>
          <li>The higher the header 'h' number is, the smaller the header size.</li>

          <li>'git pull origin main': Pulls the branch's modifications into a local environment. The use of 'origin' shows that it will be pulled from the GitHub repo. As for the 'main', it's pulling from the main branch in the repo.</li>
          <li>'git push origin branch-name': Pushes the changes from local branch and into the remote branch. The push command can both add changes to an existing branch or make a new <i>remote</i> branch.</li>
