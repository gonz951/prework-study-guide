        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Starting off any code with '!DOCTYPE html' prepares the computer to render it in said coding language.</li>
          <li>The 'doctype' command is <i>not</i> case sensitive.</li>
          <li>The 'head' element contains the information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The 'body' element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The 'title' element is used for the title of the webpage.</li>
          <li>Adding 'html lang="eng"' lets the browser know the website is written in english.</li>
          <li>The 'p' element is for paragraphs.</li>
          <li>The 'br' element is for breaks between elements in the page.</li>
          <li>The 'ul' element is for unordered lists, but the 'ol' element is for ordered lists (AKA: numbered list).</li>
          <li>Both types of lists need the 'li' element to add points to the list.</li>
          <li>An image 'src' allows the computer to locate which files an image is located in.</li>
          <li>The 'a' (anchor) element starts off a link and href will allow the computer to find the link stated.</li>
          <li>'h1' should only be used once on a page.</li>
          <li>The higher the header 'h' number is, the smaller the header size.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the <i>outside</i> of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content <i>inside</i> an element.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS: Quick but hard to change in bulk. It can only apply to one element, but it sticks well once it's there.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS: Uses the 'style' element in the 'head' element to set a rule. Can apply to an element in bulk, but also tedious to change.</li>
          <li>External CSS: Using the 'link' element, a file can be linked into the main HTML 'head' element in order to place CSS over everything in a webpage.</li>
          <li>CSS Rule: div {color: blue; text-align: justify;}
            <dd>- 'Div': Selector; The element the following CSS will apply to.</dd>
            <dd>- 'Color'/'text-align': Property; Further specifying what the following CSS will do within the element.</dd>
            <dd>- 'Blue'/'Justify': Value; The effect being done to the content within the element.</dd>
            <dd>- 'Color: blue;': Declaration; A prompt to change something.</dd>
            <dd>- '{color: blue; text-align: justify;}': Declaration block; A set of prompts to change one element.</dd> 
          </li>
          <li>CSS can be applied to multiple elements through the use of a comma (,) between the selectors before the curly braces ({}).</li>
          <li>CSS can be applied to everything with the use of an asterick (*) in the first space.</li>

          <li>'git checkout branch-name or main': can be used to move from other branches to main. Can also be used from main to pre-exiting branches.</li>

          <li>'git add': adds modifications from the current working branch and into the staging area.</li>
          <li>'git add -A': indicates that we want to add all changes. Everything together informs Git that it will all be added to the next commit.</li>
          <li>'git commit -m "commit message": commits the changes into the branch. The quoted line is to describe what the commit contains.</li>
          <li>'git pull origin main': Pulls the branch's modifications into a local environment. The use of 'origin' shows that it will be pulled from the GitHub repo. As for the 'main', it's pulling from the main branch in the repo.</li>
          <li>'git push origin branch-name': Pushes the changes from local branch and into the remote branch. The push command can both add changes to an existing branch or make a new <i>remote</i> branch.</li>
