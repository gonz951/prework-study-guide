# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description

The Prework Study Guide for this coding bootcamp was made in mind for helping new, overwhelmed students in this coding bootcamp. This project was both made as a learning experience and a way to keep my notes in a conveninent place. It can be used by other students as another perspective or as reference for things they might have forgotten to note down in their own study guide. It was a platform to test out the basics and warm myself up to coding; a sandbox.

## Usage

Each section found on the webpage is a set of notes respective to the Coding Language above it. The following notes are: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. There are also elements on the page which display how these notes were used, and if one were to inspect the page then it would display how JavaScript runs in it. All the information needed is put in one place, so there are no other webpages attached.
